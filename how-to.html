<h1>How to buy books from a Paperight outlet</h1>

<p>Paperight allows any&nbsp;business with any printer to act as a print-on-demand bookstore. If you want to buy a book print-out from a Paperight outlet, here&#39;s how it works:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.paperight.com/outlets">Find a Paperight outlet here</a>. Any&nbsp;organisation with a computer, Internet connection, and a printer can&nbsp;<a href="/register?outlet=true">register as an outlet here</a>. It takes a couple of minutes. Ideally, they should have a large laser printer or photocopier-printer, and a way to bind lots of pages, such as a ring-binding machine or binder files.</li>
	<li>The outlet then finds the book you need on paperight.com. For instance, if you&#39;re a nurse, you might want them to find you the <a href="/product/11/Newborn-Care-Creators-Perinatal-Education-Programme"><em>Newborn Care</em></a> book.</li>
	<li>The outlet enters your name and phone number on paperight.com (it will appear on your print-out), and clicks a button. They are now legally allowed to print out a copy for you.</li>
	<li>The outlet downloads and prints out&nbsp;the book, or (if you have a copy already, and a photocopy-licence is available for it on paperight.com)&nbsp;downloads and prints a licence to photocopy it for you.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You pay the outlet one price that includes&nbsp;their printing costs and the publisher&#39;s licence fee (the outlet pays Paperight, and we pay the publisher). This is calculated on the outlet&#39;s screen on Paperight.</li>
</ol>
