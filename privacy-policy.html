<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<p><em>Updated 20 August 2013</em></p>

<p>In offering an online service, Paperight collects information about you and your organisation. If you register with Paperight as an outlet or rightsholder, or even if you simply access and print a document at a Paperight outlet, you should know that you will be sharing information with the Paperight team.</p>

<p>This privacy policy governs Paperight&rsquo;s use of the information that you share in the course of using the Paperight service.</p>

<p>This policy works in conjunction with the terms of service for both outlets and rightsholders. We may amend this policy at any time, at the event of which you will be immediately notified if you are registered with Paperight as either a rightsholder or outlet.</p>

<h2>What Paperight does and does not do with your information</h2>

<p>First things first: no matter which way you use Paperight, we will never sell or otherwise give your personal information to unauthorised third-parties. We hate spam and scams as much as you do, so we&#39;ll do our best to ensure that your information doesn&#39;t get into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>When you visit the Paperight website, we will access and store information about your visit, potentially but not necessarily including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the technical specifications of the software and operating system you used to access the Paperight site;</li>
	<li>the IP address and location from which you accessed the Paperight site; and</li>
	<li>the links that may have directed you to the Paperight site.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is used by us to analyse the ways in which people access and use Paperight, and may be anonymised and used by us for marketing or communications with partners.</p>

<h2>Rightsholders (publishers)</h2>

<p>If you are a rightsholder registered with Paperight, your name and products will be publicly listed on the Paperight website and may be distributed to Paperight outlets in the form of newsletters, blog posts or other communications, so that they may be informed of your products available through the Paperight service.</p>

<p>Your name and products may also be used as part of Paperight&#39;s communications and marketing, in order to attract certain customers to existing or new Paperight outlets. Your products&#39; metadata (including titles, author names, product subject matter, licence fees, image covers and product descriptions) may be used in and repurposed for Paperight&#39;s external communications and marketing, in order to promote your products and the Paperight service. Paperight will not claim to own content belonging to a registered rightsholder.</p>

<p>Information about the number and value of rights sales of your products will be gathered, and may be shared in an anonymised aggregated format with Paperight outlets and in external Paperight communications, such as blog posts, press releases and advertisements. Sales rankings of your individual products may also be displayed publicly (like the bestseller lists you find in commercial bookstores or online retailers).</p>

<p>Should your account be closed, data pertaining to past sales (such as invoices and statements) will remain accessible to the parties to those sales.</p>

<h2>Outlets</h2>

<p>If you are an outlet registered with Paperight, your outlet&#39;s name, location and contact details may be publicly listed on the Paperight website, in order to help customers find your business. If you wish, you may ask us to remove your name, location and contact details from any public listing of Paperight outlets.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to give anonymised information about your outlet to potential and registered rightsholders so that they can know where their documents are or will be available at any given time. In addition to that, rightsholders are able to see which and how many of their documents your outlet sells and at what time they were sold, but not the details of the persons to whom you sold them. Paperight, however, reserves the right to access the name and mobile number, if given, of the persons to whom you sell documents at any time, but not to use that name and mobile number for marketing purposes. We may also use your location, name and contact details in our advertising campaigns, in order to promote our service to potential customers in your area.</p>

<p>If you register with Paperight as an outlet, you are allowed the right to deactivate your account at any time. Deactivation, however, will not restrict our internal access to, or use of as described above, information about the sales your outlet made, the persons to which your outlet made those sales, and your outlet&#39;s name, location, contact details and users, while your registration with Paperight was active.</p>

<h2>Outlet customers</h2>

<p>If you are the customer of a Paperight outlet, both Paperight and the outlet from which you printed a document from Paperight will keep your name, which is printed on your Paperight document, on record. Paperight will never share your individual identity with any third-party other than the Paperight outlet through which you printed your document. Outlets who register with Paperight are also bound by our outlet terms-of-service not to share or sell your individual identity or information with third-parties.</p>

<p>We will also gather certain information about you should you visit a URL printed on any Paperight document, including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
	<li>the date and time at which you access the URL;</li>
	<li>the location from which you access the URL;</li>
	<li>the device on which you access the URL;</li>
	<li>the metadata of the document on which the URL is printed; and</li>
	<li>the person and outlet who printed the document on which the URL is printed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information, but not your name or other details (such as your mobile phone number) that identify you personally, may be shared with rightsholders and outlets for statistical purposes.</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to supply this information, along with any other information we have gathered about customers, rightsholders and outlets, to relevant authorities should we be required to do so by a court of law. If you have any concerns or questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@paperight.com">team@paperight.com</a>.</p>
