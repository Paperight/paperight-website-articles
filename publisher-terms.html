<h1>Publisher agreement</h1>

<p>For an easy guide to how Paperight works, see our Publisher Guide on <a href="http://help.paperight.com">help.paperight.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>Updated 19 August 2014</em></p>

<p>By registering as a Publisher with Paperight, you&rsquo;re accepting the terms of this agreement on behalf of your organisation as provided at registration. Paperight may update these terms and conditions from time to time, and give notice to you. Within 14 days of receiving notice of updated terms and conditions you may cancel the agreement or you will be bound by the updated terms.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>Paperight is a service that lets publishers sell licences to registered outlets. These licences allow the outlets to print and sell copies of the Rightsholder&rsquo;s documents, which Paperight provides to them as watermarked PDFs, and/or allows them to legally photocopy the Rightsholder&rsquo;s documents&nbsp;under license. Paperight is only one of the channels that a publisher might use to make its works available, and does not claim to be exclusive.</p>

<p>A Publisher is referred to as the Rightsholder in this agreement.</p>

<p>This agreement governs the relationship between Paperight and the Rightsholder.</p>

<h3>Term and termination</h3>

<p>Either party may suspend or terminate this agreement by notifying the other in writing with 14 days notice. If that happens, outstanding earnings owed to the Rightsholder will still be paid according to the Compensation terms below. Watermarked documents and photocopy licences&nbsp;may still be available through the Paperight system during the notice period.</p>

<p>Paperight will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Rightsholder&#39;s documents are not available for licensing,&nbsp;download or purchase by outlets or their customers by the termination date.</p>

<h3>Operating policies and procedures</h3>

<p>Paperight provides print-on-demand distribution and photocopy licensing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Print-on-demand distribution:&nbsp;The Rightsholder will provide documents and document metadata&nbsp;to Paperight for distribution via paperight.com. For distribution to registered outlets, Paperight will resize these documents and place them on new page sizes (such as A4), along with fineprint containing selected details of each licence, including the names of the Rightsholder, the outlet, and the outlet&rsquo;s customer, and the date of the licence. The Rightsholder may specify which documents should and should not be made available to outlets at any time, and in which countries.</li>
	<li>Photocopy-licensing: The Rightsholder will provide document metadata to Paperight for listing on paperight.com. The Rightsholder may specify which documents should and should not be made available for licensed photocopying to outlets at any time, and in which countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the metadata for each document, the Rightsholder will elect to allow print-on-demand distribution and/or photocopy licensing.</p>

<p>Paperight will conduct this service as it is described publicly on paperight.com, which will change from time to time at Paperight&rsquo;s discretion.</p>

<p>Paperight will gather data about users, including rightsholders and outlets and their territories, on its website in the normal course of doing business online. How Paperight uses that data is described separately in the privacy policy published on paperight.com.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of Rightsholder and Paperight</h3>

<p>The Rightsholder is responsible for providing accurate metadata and up-to-date versions of its documents in the formats required by Paperight, or as agreed with the Rightsholder from time to time.</p>

<p>Paperight is responsible for accurately reflecting this metadata on paperight.com, and for taking all reasonable measures to keep source (as opposed to public or purchased) metadata and documents safe from theft.</p>

<p>Paperight will take reasonable measures to monitor usage of its services to spot misuse, such as unlicensed photocopying or redistribution of content. Where evidence of misuse exists, Paperight will take action under the terms of its outlet agreement published on paperight.com at the time. That action may include suspending the user accounts of offending outlets, and/or providing evidence of copyright infringement to the Rightsholder and relevant authorities. The Rightsholder retains the right to enforce its copyrights.</p>

<p>Paperight&#39;s terms for outlets will include the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One fee = one print-out: For each copy of a document that an outlet prints out, it must pay a separate licence fee. (For example, if an outlet pays to make one print-out of The Great Gatsby, it is only allowed to print it out once.) As such, an outlet may only sell this one print-out to one customer.</li>
	<li>Customer&#39;s full name, every time: An outlet must provide the customer&#39;s full name (e.g. first and last name) each time it buys a licence. When printing on demand, the&nbsp;customer&#39;s name will then appear on each page of their document, along with a unique tracking code. An outlet may not re-print one customer&#39;s document for another customer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compensation and currency</h3>

<p>The Rightsholder will determine the licence fee to be paid by an outlet for each copy in United States dollars. Paperight will pay to the Rightsholder 80% of these licence fees, converted to the publisher&rsquo;s designated currency at a commercial rate at the time of each completed transaction. The commercial rate used by Paperight shall be available on request.</p>

<p>Should a Rightsholder set a licence fee of zero for a particular document (that is, a free licence), Paperight reserves the right to charge outlets a service fee in lieu of a licence fee, and to charge the Rightsholder a distribution fee. The amount of the distribution fee will be agreed in advance between Paperight and the Rightsholder.</p>

<p>Paperight will pay earnings from licence sales to the Rightsholder at the Rightsholder&#39;s request, up to once a month. If sales revenue is withheld by financial or regulatory processes (e.g. withholding amounts held by credit-card payment companies to cover chargebacks), earnings may be reduced accordingly until that revenue is actually received by Paperight. Paperight will provide a statement to the Rightsholder detailing these licence sales, including sales quantities and the value of licences sold by title or identifier.</p>

<p>When an outlet purchases a licence, Paperight automatically generates an invoice on behalf of the Rightsholder to the outlet for the full licence fee, and from Paperight to the Rightsholder for Paperight&#39;s 20% commission on that licence fee. These invoices include VAT. The Rightsholder is responsible for keeping their VAT details up-to-date in their Paperight account settings. Changes to the way that VAT is calculated and paid may be required by national revenue agencies, and these changes may affect past transactions.</p>

<h3>Licences</h3>

<p>When a registered outlet requests a licence to print or copy a&nbsp;copyright work (e.g. a book, journal or document) on paperight.com, they are automatically granted a license by the Rightsholder to reproduce and distribute the requested copyright works which the Rightsholder has made available through Paperight. The Rightsholder authorises Paperight to exercise any of the exclusive rights granted by law to the Rightsholder in order to enable Paperight to make the copyright works available to registered outlets in terms of this agreement, including but not limited to reproduction, distribution and transmission of the works. The licences granted to outlets and Paperight are non-exclusive. The Rightsholder retains the right to grant other licences to the works.</p>

<p>The Rightsholder authorises Paperight to provide previews of any copyright work provided to Paperight by the Rightsholder, including the cover image, which Paperight may make available to the outlets and to the public. No royalty or other fee shall be paid by Paperight or the outlets to the Rightsholder for previews. A preview may consist of up to 15% of a document, or up to 20% of a work if the work is five pages or less in length. The percentage of a work shall be determined by reference to pages.</p>

<h3>Warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability</h3>

<p>All services provided by Paperight are provided on an &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; basis. Paperight does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted or error free.</p>

<p>Paperight&rsquo;s total liability to the Rightsholder for any damages (regardless of why the Rightsholder seeks damages) shall not exceed in total the revenue received by Paperight from rights sales of the Rightsholder&rsquo;s content in the month before the incident giving rise to the liability.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Paperight or the Rightsholder, their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable for punitive, consequential, incidental, exemplary, indirect or special damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, revenues, business, use, data or other intangibles, whether or not such damages were foreseeable &ndash; and even if Paperight or the Rightsholder had been advised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages.</p>

<p>The Rightsholder acknowledges that due to the nature of the internet, and despite Paperight&rsquo;s best reasonable efforts, some licences may be sold, and related content delivered, in geographic territories for which the Rightsholder and/or Paperight do not have rights to sell such licences. The Rightsholder therefore waives any claim, not due to negligence by Paperight, for damages against Paperight for licences sold to outlets in geographic territories for which either party may not have rights.</p>

<h3>Indemnity</h3>

<p>The Rightsholder warrants that it is the owner of, or is authorized to licence, the rights to all content provided to Paperight. This content (a) is not libellous, slanderous, defamatory, obscene or pornographic; (b) does not infringe on anyone else&rsquo;s intellectual property or other rights, such as their privacy; (c) does not violate applicable laws or regulations; (d) does not contain any harmful or malicious computer code. The Rightsholder will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Paperight, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents against any third-party claims arising from a breach of this warranty.</p>

<p>Paperight will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Rightsholder, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents against any third-party claims caused by Paperight&rsquo;s negligence in distributing content, unless those claims arise from the negligence or willful misconduct of the Rightsholder.</p>

<p>If either party receives notice of a claim in respect of the copyright or moral rights in the works, or of alleged infringement, it shall notify the other party within five days. The notification shall be treated with appropriate confidentiality. If either party claims this indemnification, they will give the other prompt notice in writing. Each party shall be entitled to choose their own counsel.</p>

<p>As Paperight relies on the warranty of ownership or right to licence by the Rightsholder in the event of any copyright or infringement claim, Paperight may settle or dispute or make any other arrangments in respect of the claim against Paperight without the consent or prior notice of the Rightsholder. If a claim is made against Paperight on the basis that the Rightsholder lacks ownership or the right to licence a document, then the Rightsholder shall reimburse Paperight for the reasonable legal costs of assessing, responding to or defending the claim, the costs to be determined according to statutory tarrifs.</p>

<p>Paperight has no authority on behalf of the Rightsholder to admit or settle or dispute copyright claims in respect of the documents supplied by a Rightsholder.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>

<p>If either party cannot fulfil its obligations because of an event beyond their reasonable control (including any act of God, actions by any government authority, fires, floods, natural disasters, riots, wars, labour problems such as lockouts and strikes, or communications systems failures), any delay or failure will be excused until circumstances permit business to continue as before. This does not apply to obligations to pay money due.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>Should either party intend to transfer this Agreement or any of its rights and obligations to another party, they will inform the other party with at least 14 days notice, so that they may have an opportunity to review or terminate the Agreement. After transfer, this Agreement will be binding on any successors and assigns. Written notice is not required where Paperight or the Rightsholder assigns all or most of its assets to another party, in which case the acquiring party assumes all of the rights and obligations in this agreement.</p>

<h3>Governing law</h3>

<p>If there are any disputes between the parties, they will be governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
